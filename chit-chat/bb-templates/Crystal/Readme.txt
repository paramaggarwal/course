Just copy the contents of this folder to the following directory

yourbbpress.com\bb-templates and you should see the layout in action..

To edit the header links please open the header and edit as required.. 


To Modify the header create a New transparent image in photoshop of size 225 x 100 and follow the instructions below

1. Create a new document. The size isn’t too terribly important; mine is 225×100 pixels. The background should be transparent, NOT WHITE.
2. Create a new layer. This is your text layer. Select a font you like, I used Arial Rounded. The size of the font may vary; I used 40pt.
3. Type in your text.
4. If you want to change the color of the text you may do so, it won’t affect anything.
5. Click file > save for web
6. The Matte color should be the exact same color of the background which this title image will be against. Mine is #333333.
7. Save as title.gif in the images directory and you should be fine. 

Upload and have fun..
