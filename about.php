			<p>JAM Sessions (Just A Minute Sessions) is an activity in which a person has to show his or her individual caliber in instantaneous thinking and presentation. In this kind of session a person is individually given a topic on the spot and then given  30 seconds to frame what is to be said.
			 Because just one miunute is given for representation of thought so points are given on opening and closing of speech, fluency, framing of the points, and the total information provided.</p><br />
			<p>

			<li>Validity of information</li>
			<li>Focus on the topic</li>
			<li>Time management.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>This practice is useful as it help in making a person capable of giving instant and presise answers. This helps in having a good first impression. Since "First impression is the last impression" so this comes in very handy.</p>

			<p>A debate is a contest, or, perhaps, like a game, where two or more speakers present their argument intent on persuing one another on a certain topic.</p>
<p>
In a debate the following rules are to followed
<ul>
<li> There should be two teams. Each team consists of two or three speakers.</li>
<li> The speeches and speaking time are divided equally between the two teams.</li>
<li> The topic should not be partial to one side.</li>
<li> Judgement should be done on the basis of
<ul>
	<li>	Time management.</li>
	<li>	Content.</li>
	<li>	Layout.</li>
	<li>	Presentation.</li>
	<li>	Clarity of thoughts.</li>
	<li>	validity of points presented.</li></ul>
</li></ul></p><br />

<p>Debate is a uniquely beneficial educational tool in part because of the value of argumentation theory itself. The creation of an argument is one of the most complex cognitive acts that a person can engage in. Creating an argument requires the research of issues, organization of data, analysis of data, synthesis of different kinds of data, and an evaluation of information with respect to which conclusion it may point.</p><br />

<p>After this process, the formulation of an argument requires the debater to consider differing methods of critiquing reason, the decision-making formula, the audience and the criteria of decision making. In the end, arguments must be communicated to an audience clearly and succinctly - a difficult cognitive process requiring conversion between thought, written rhetoric and oral rhetoric. At the end, the debate itself requires the processing of other's arguments and then the reformulation and defense of one's original position.

 	<p>"Writing Skill" is an activity in which Formal Writing is practised.
For Formal Writing Skills the following things are to be taken care of</p>
<p>In general, it is inappropriate simply to write as you would speak.
<ul>
<li><b>Writing formally</b></li>
<p> In conversation, the listener can ask for clarification or elaboration easily, and thus the speaker can use imprecise language, ramble from topic to topic freely, and so on. Formal writing must instead stand on its own, conveying the author's thesis clearly through words alone. As a result, formal writing requires substantial effort to construct meaningful sentences, paragraphs, and arguments relevant to a well-defined thesis. The best formal writing will be difficult to write but very easy to read; the author's time and effort spent on writing will be repaid with the time and effort saved by the readers. 
</p>
<li><b>Making a good thesis</b></li>
<p>An essay, article, or report should have one main topic (the "thesis") that is clearly evident in the introduction and conclusion. Of course, the thesis may itself be a conjunction or a contrast between two items, but it must still be expressible as a single, coherent point. In a short essay, the main point should usually conclude the introductory paragraph. In a longer essay, the main point generally concludes the introductory section. The reader should never be in any doubt about what your thesis is; whenever you think it might not be absolutely obvious, remind the reader again.
